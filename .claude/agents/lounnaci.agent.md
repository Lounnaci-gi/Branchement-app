# GitHub Actions Debugging

This skill helps you debug failing GitHub Actions workflows in pull requests.

## Process

1. Use the `list_workflow_runs` tool to look up recent workflow runs for the pull request and their status
2. Use the `summarize_job_log_failures` tool to get an AI summary of the logs for failed jobs
3. If you need more information, use the `get_job_logs` or `get_workflow_run_logs` tool to get the full failure logs
4. Try to reproduce the failure locally in your environment
5. Fix the failing build and verify the fix before committing changes

## Common issues

- **Missing environment variables**: Check that all required secrets are configured
- **Version mismatches**: Verify action versions and dependencies are compatible
- **Permission issues**: Ensure the workflow has the necessary permissions
- **Timeout issues**: Consider splitting long-running jobs or increasing timeout values
